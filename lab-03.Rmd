# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

Bars are different widths and do not represent the scale of the data at all.
The unit changes between bars and so makes reading the graph very difficult.
The Colours on the graph are not aesthetically pleasing.



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```


This graph does not really respect people, as there are too many points in small areas of the graph. This results in it being impossible to read _which_ country is represented for a number of points, therefore making it difficult to use. In addition, the points are of different sizes (with no explanation as to why) and this means the labels on some entries are too small to read. Although the different colours, translucent points, and labelled points are pleasant, the graph is too difficult to read.


We have no labels for the Axes other than Axis titles, and this means we have no idea _what_ is represented on each axis -- we know neither the values for life expectancy nor how 'Rule of Law' has been measured and quantified. We also have no idea what the different sizes of point represent. This graph needs scales on the axes and for the points, in order to begin to make sense of what is represented.



## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")

# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
Wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
55



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```


## Exercise 3
